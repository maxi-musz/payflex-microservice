Since you're deploying the services separately but want them to share the same database with different schemas, you need to manage Prisma migrations carefully to avoid conflicts. Hereâ€™s the best approach:

### **1. Centralized Migration Management**
- You should **designate one service** (e.g., `identity-service`) as the **migration owner**.
- This means only **one Prisma instance** will generate and apply migrations.
- The other services will only **generate Prisma clients** from the existing schema.

### **2. Steps to Implement This**

#### **Step 1: Choose a Migration Owner**
Pick `identity-service` as the migration owner. It will handle all Prisma migrations.

#### **Step 2: Update the `schema.prisma` of `identity-service`**
Modify its **datasource** to include all schemas:
```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  schemas  = ["identity", "transaction_histories", "banking"]
}
```
Then, copy all models from `transaction-history-service` and `banking-service` into this **single schema.prisma file**.

#### **Step 3: Generate Migrations in `identity-service`**
Run:
```sh
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```
This creates a single migration file for all schemas.

#### **Step 4: Configure Other Services**
For `transaction-history-service`, `banking-service`, etc., modify their `schema.prisma`:
- **Do not run migrations here.**
- Only generate Prisma clients.

Example for `transaction-history-service`:
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["multiSchema"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  schemas  = ["transaction_histories"]
}
```
Then, run:
```sh
npx prisma generate
```
Repeat for `banking-service`.

#### **Step 5: Deploying Services**
- Deploy `identity-service` **first** (since it runs migrations).
- Deploy others afterward. They only use `prisma generate`.

### **3. Key Benefits**
- **No migration conflicts** since only one service manages them.
- **All services still use their respective schemas.**
- **Smooth deployment** as other services donâ€™t need to worry about migrations.
